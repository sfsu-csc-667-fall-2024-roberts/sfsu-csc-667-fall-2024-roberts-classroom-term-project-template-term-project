            <p>
                The goal of Sequence is to form a sequence of five chips in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
                The first player (or team) to form two sequences of five in a row wins the game.

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>- Sequence is played with two decks of standard playing cards.</p>
            <p>- Each player or team gets a set of colored chips (one color per player/team).</p>
            <p>- The game board consists of a 10x10 grid of cards.</p>
            <p>- Each card in the grid represents a card from a standard deck.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>- Players take turns placing their chips on the corresponding card on the board.</p>
            <p>- A player must have a matching card in their hand to place a chip on the board.</p>
            <p>- The card is placed by selecting an open space on the board where the card appears.</p>
            <p>- A player cannot place a chip on a space already occupied by another player's chip.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Special Cards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jacks:</strong> Jacks are wild cards in the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Eyed Jacks:</strong> These can be used as any card to help form a sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>One-Eyed Jacks:</strong> These can be used to remove an opponent's chip from the board.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
            <p>
                A player or team wins the game by being the first to form two sequences of five in a row. 
                A sequence can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. The first team to achieve this is declared the winner.

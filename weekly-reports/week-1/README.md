Necessary Features for a Full Monopoly Game App

Based on the current steps and what we have so far, here are the necessary features to complete a working Monopoly game app and what has been implemented so far:

What We Have So Far:

	1.	Basic Project Setup:
	•	Frontend built with React.js and TypeScript.
	•	Backend set up with Node.js, Express.js, and WebSockets for real-time communication.
	•	Tailwind CSS for responsive and easy-to-maintain styling.
	2.	Monopoly Board Layout:
	•	Basic layout using an 11x11 CSS Grid with properties and corner spaces.
	•	Properties styled with their appropriate colors (Mediterranean Ave, Reading Railroad, etc.).
	•	Corners such as GO and Jail properly positioned.
	3.	Player Movement Logic:
	•	Dice rolling mechanism implemented with 2d6 (two six-sided dice).
	•	Players move based on dice rolls, and their position is tracked and updated.
	4.	WebSocket Communication:
	•	Real-time communication between server and client to sync game events (dice rolls, player movement).
	•	Event broadcasting (e.g., dice rolled) is set up for future multiplayer expansion.
	5.	Basic UI:
	•	Buttons for rolling dice.
	•	Display of current dice rolls and player position.

Necessary Features (To Be Implemented):

Here’s a breakdown of all the necessary features that will turn the game into a full-fledged Monopoly app:

1. Core Gameplay Mechanics:

Player Movement:

	•	What’s missing: Currently, we just roll the dice and update player position. The movement logic needs to:
	•	Detect what space the player landed on (property, Chance, Community Chest, tax, etc.).
	•	Trigger different actions based on the type of space.

Property Management:

	•	Buying Properties: When a player lands on an unowned property, they should be prompted to buy it or auction it if declined.
	•	Rent Payment: When a player lands on another player’s property, they should pay rent based on how developed the property is (houses, hotels).
	•	Auction: If a player refuses to buy a property, implement an auction system where other players can bid on it.

Houses & Hotels:

	•	Develop Properties: Once a player owns all properties in a color set, they should be able to build houses and hotels on them.
	•	Building Rules: Houses must be built evenly across properties in the set.
	•	Increase Rent: Rent must increase with the number of houses or hotels built.

2. Cards and Special Spaces:

Chance & Community Chest:

	•	What’s missing: Chance and Community Chest cards are not implemented yet. These need to be added with logic to:
	•	Draw a card.
	•	Apply its effect (e.g., collect money, pay money, go to jail, etc.).

Jail System:

	•	Going to Jail: When a player lands on the Go to Jail space, they should be sent directly to jail.
	•	Leaving Jail: Players should be able to:
	•	Pay $50.
	•	Roll doubles to leave.
	•	Use a Get Out of Jail Free card if they have one.

3. Banking System:

Financial Transactions:

	•	Players need to be able to:
	•	Pay rent, taxes, and fees.
	•	Receive money when another player lands on their property.

Bankruptcy:

	•	Bankruptcy Handling: If a player cannot pay rent or a fee, they should have to mortgage properties or sell houses/hotels.
	•	Out of Game: If they are unable to pay even after selling properties, they should declare bankruptcy and forfeit their assets.

4. Trading:

Property Trading:

	•	What’s missing: Players should be able to trade properties, money, and Get Out of Jail Free cards with other players.
	•	Negotiation System: Implement a system where players can offer properties and money to other players, and the other player can accept or counter.

5. Multiplayer (Optional for Now):

Real-Time Multiplayer:

	•	Current Status: WebSocket setup is already in place, but it only handles dice rolls.
	•	What’s needed:
	•	Implement player turns in real-time so that only the current player can roll the dice.
	•	Sync the entire game state across all players (e.g., property ownership, player positions, rent payments).

6. Game State Management:

Storing Game State:

	•	Current Status: Player movement and dice rolls are local to the client and temporarily broadcast via WebSockets.
	•	What’s needed:
	•	Store the entire game state (including player positions, property ownership, finances, and houses/hotels).
	•	Ensure that the server is the source of truth for game state and syncs it with all clients.

Game End:

	•	Bankruptcy Handling: Players who go bankrupt should be removed from the game, and their assets either go to the creditor or the bank.
	•	End Condition: The game ends when all but one player is bankrupt, and they are declared the winner.

7. UI/UX Enhancements:

Board Representation:

	•	Add better visual representations of houses, hotels, and player tokens on the board.

Player Interaction:

	•	In-Game Messages: Display a log of actions (e.g., rent paid, player bankruptcies, dice rolls).
	•	Prompts: Pop up prompts for buying properties, paying rent, or rolling again after rolling doubles.

Conclusion:

So far, we have the foundational structure of the Monopoly game:

	•	A React-based frontend with a grid-based board layout.
	•	Basic player movement and dice rolling logic.
	•	WebSocket setup for real-time communication.

What’s missing:

	•	Key gameplay mechanics like property buying, rent payment, houses/hotels, and handling special spaces (Chance, Community Chest, Jail).
	•	A more complex state management system to track properties, finances, and player states.
	•	Visual enhancements for player tokens, property ownership, and game events.

By implementing these features step by step, we will have a fully working Monopoly game that can be tested and expanded for both single-player and multiplayer modes.

3. We did a bit of milestone 3 cleanup over the weekend - fixed a problem with "/" routes conflicting in index.ts, and added typescript to livereload. Andrew started the first part of Milestone 4 (cleaning up routes/livereload logic).
4. Week 4 milestone: We're collectively going back to study some of the prior lectures to better figure out milestone 4. We have a few test pages but need to make official ones for authentication, and also add database logic.

What was accomplished this week: We did Milestone 2 which involved setting up the development environments for the back end of the project.

Milestone 2: We had to create a simple webserver that will serve as the skeleton/foundation of our site. It is incredibly basic but it involved setting up the directory structure, creating a basic express server, organizing the server code, setting up middleware and error handling, serving static files, and setting up a way to debug in the future
